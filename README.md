# SWM573 - Document Clustering Summarization and Visualization

Explore different clustering algorithms, Implemented on the dataset

## Project Abstract & Aim
The aim of this project is to:
- Explore different clustering algorithms, Implemented on the dataset
- Cluster the news articles
- Recommend similar articles that are available similar to the documents
- Extract keywords in the articles and provide a short summary
- Apply Visualization techniques on the textual document to showcase relevancy 
- Identifying anomalies in the dataset
- Identifying popular words in each group - like a word cloud

## DataSet Used
Dataset used - 20 Newsgroups Dataset (http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/)
Using sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups

## Run time and Instances
We used the google colab and Pycharm Jupyter notebook for additional CPU and GPU support and dataset storage


## Algorithms and Visualization Techniques used
### Clustering
- LDA  
- HDBScan
- Agglomerative clustering

### Visualization Techniques
- t-SNE
- UMAP
- Compression-VAE
